# Unreal Engine 1 sdks

This repo contains c++ sdks for several Unreal Engine 1 games.
They have been updated and fixed to be easier to build on modern compilers.
Primarily made for building the [D3D9DrvRTX](https://github.com/mmdanggg2/D3D9DrvRTX) render device.

The majority of fixes have been pulled from the excelent work by the OldUnreal team on the [UT v469d](https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches) sdk.

Special thanks to [Sebastian Kaufel](https://coding.hanfling.de/launch/) for the Nerf sdk and keeping downloads to other original sdk's available

The unmodified official sdk's are also available in the `official` branch
